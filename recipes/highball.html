    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Got Japanese whisky? Let’s make a highball! The Japanese Highball is a variation on the Whiskey Highball using Japanese whisky, ode to the country’s fascination with drinking these tall, bubbly drinks. Highballs are popular in Japan since they make conveniently low alcohol cocktails that are easy to sip. Combine liquor with bubbly sparkling water, and you’ve got a refreshing drink that helps you consume alcohol a little more slowly. This one’s a great way to enjoy your favorite Japanese whisky. Here’s how to make it!</p>

        <li>1 part Japanese whisky</li>
        <li>4 parts club soda or soda water</li>
        <li>Lemon wedge</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Squeeze the lemon wedge into a highball glass.</li>
        <li>Add the ice and whiskey and stir with a bar spoon until chilled. Top with soda water and serve.</li>
